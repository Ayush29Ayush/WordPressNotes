#? Steps to ressolve this error:

a) The MySQL configuration file (my.ini) is located in the MySQL installation directory within your XAMPP installation. By default, this path is usually: "C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini". Then change the port number from 3306 to 3307 in this file.

b) The properties.ini file in xampp directory
In the [MySQL] section, change the following lines:

From:
mysql_port=3306
mysql_arguments=-u root -P 3306

To:
mysql_port=3307
mysql_arguments=-u root -P 3307

c) xampp-control.ini file in xampp directory
In the [ServicePorts] section, change the following line:

From:
MySQL=3306

To:
MySQL=3307

d) C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin\config.inc.php
Set "$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = '127.0.0.1';" to "127.0.0.1:3307"

#? Steps to Follow
* Stop XAMPP Services: Make sure all XAMPP services are stopped before making changes.
* Edit Configuration Files: Open the properties.ini and xampp-control.ini files with a text editor and make the changes as described above.
* Save the Files: Save the changes to the files.
* Restart XAMPP: Start the XAMPP Control Panel and try running MySQL again.

#! After resolving the error, start XAMPP.

Now, we can observe that the error is resoved.

Ques) What is the use of these 2 files?
Ans) 
* The properties.ini and xampp-control.ini files in XAMPP are configuration files that help define various settings for the XAMPP environment, including port numbers, file paths, and module configurations.

** properties.ini
This file contains configuration details for the different components within XAMPP, such as Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Key sections include:

[General]: Specifies general settings like the installation directory and version information.
[Apache]: Contains settings related to the Apache server, such as the server port, SSL port, and directories for configuration and document root.
[MySQL]: Specifies MySQL settings, including the port number, host, directories for binary files, and data, as well as configuration details.
[PHP]: Contains PHP-related settings, like the directory for PHP binaries and configuration files.
The properties.ini file is mainly used for configuring the fundamental aspects of the XAMPP stack, including where components are located and which ports they use.

**  xampp-control.ini
This file is used by the XAMPP Control Panel to manage how the interface interacts with the various services (like Apache, MySQL, FileZilla, etc.) within XAMPP. Key sections include:

[Common]: General settings for the XAMPP Control Panel, such as editor and browser preferences, debug settings, and language.
[EnableModules]: Specifies which modules (e.g., Apache, MySQL) are enabled in the control panel.
[LogSettings] and [WindowSettings]: Define the appearance of logs and the control panel window settings.
[Autostart]: Specifies which services should start automatically when XAMPP starts.
[ServicePorts]: Defines the default ports for various services, such as Apache, MySQL, FileZilla, etc.
The xampp-control.ini file primarily manages the user interface and behavior of the XAMPP Control Panel, ensuring it knows how to start, stop, and configure the various services included in XAMPP.
